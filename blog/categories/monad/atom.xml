    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve played with owin in F# <a href="https://github.com/simonhdickson/Bar">before</a> and recently have been playing with computational builders. So I thought the other day, how about combining them both so you can write something long the lines of this:</p>

<p>``` fsharp Owin Monad
let pipeline =</p>

<pre><code>owin {
    get "/" &lt;@ fun () -&gt; "Hello World" @&gt;
}
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Gotta love that syntactic sugar, so how do we do this? Well really, the owin monad is actually really simple to implement. You have a state, in this case the state is the is the IAppBuilder. So for posterity let&rsquo;s just steal the important bits of the state monad from FSharpx and use that. So let&rsquo;s skip to the good bit:</p>

<p>``` fsharp OwinBuilder
 type OwinBuilder() =</p>

<pre><code>// omitted
[&lt;CustomOperation("get", MaintainsVariableSpaceUsingBind=true)&gt;]
member this.Get(m, url, processor) =
    this.Bind(m, fun a -&gt;
        this.Bind(getState, fun (app:IAppBuilder) -&gt;
            putState &lt;| app.UseRequestProcessor("GET", url, processor)))
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>In a computation expression there is a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233182.aspx">standard workflow</a> for operations that you can use (this includes the Bind operation). In our case we don&rsquo;t actually want this, we want to define our own operators (for get, post, etc). The CustomOperation attribute allows you to define a these, and also describe how your custom operator works.</p>

<p>In this case we want to define our operator so that each line defines a new endpoint of our web api, and pass all the state around in the background. To do this the &ldquo;MaintainsVariableSpaceUsingBind&rdquo;, works to bind all the statements together. In the above code any previous operators will be passed in the m paramter, and then the we&rsquo;re basically appending our new owin endpoint to end of that, which will then be passed into the next operator, etc.</p>

<p>Anyway, here is a <a href="https://github.com/simonhdickson/OwinBuilder">link to the repository</a>, if you&rsquo;re interested in looking into it further.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>What is a Monad?</h3>

<p>Everyone tries to explain monads in a simple way and makes it sound way more complicated than it really is. Something is monadic if there are rule or set of rules that can define how a set of functions is combined into another function. That not strictly mathmatically true, but anything that fits that description could at least be described as monadic.</p>

<p>You might be reading that and thinking &ldquo;surely everything is monadic?&rdquo;, well yes, almost everything is kind of monadic (or can be described in that way).</p>

<h3>The Simon Says Monad</h3>

<p>May I present the single most useful monad in the world!</p>

<p>``` fsharp Simon Says
let doIt this that =</p>

<pre><code>simonSays{
    let! i = this
    let! j = that
    printfn "%i" &lt;| i + j
}
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>So, the way I see it, when you declare simonSays { &hellip; }; you&rsquo;re basically saying &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t play by normal rules: now we play by simonSays rules.&rdquo; What this means is, if you don&rsquo;t say &ldquo;Simon Says&rdquo;, then you don&rsquo;t do anything. So for example, if we invoke it like this:</p>

<p><code>fsharp Simon Says 1 + 1
doIt (SimonSays 1) (SimonSays 1)
</code></p>

<p>Then the result is SimonSays 2. However if we do:</p>

<p><code>fsharp Simon Says 1 + SimonDidntSay
doIt (SimonSays 1) SimonDidntSay
</code></p>

<p>The the result is SimonDidntSay. To go back to the definition of monads earlier, &ldquo;Something is monadic if there are rule or set of rules that can define how a set of functions is combined into another function&rdquo;. In the Simon Says monad, there is a single very simple rule: you must say &ldquo;Simon Says&rdquo;, otherwise we don&rsquo;t do anything. If we re-write this code slightly to remove all the F# sugar, it become far more obvious what is happening here.</p>

<p>``` fsharp Simon Says using matches
let doIt this that =</p>

<pre><code>match this with
| SimonSays i -&gt;
    match that with
    | SimonSays j -&gt; printfn "%i" &lt;| i + j
    | _ -&gt; ()
| _ -&gt; ()
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>If you build up a large chain of these things, then writing all this would get cumbersome.</p>

<h3>Maybe monad</h3>

<p>If you know your monads, you may have already noticed that the &ldquo;Simon Says&rdquo; monad bears a slightly resemblance to the &ldquo;Maybe&rdquo; monad. Ok, it IS actually maybe monad. Infact you can find more information about the maybe monad <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/F_Sharp_Programming/Computation_Expressions">here</a>.</p>
